Hello, my name is Joshua Rodriguez and I love to create new and interesting things.

Actually I like to work with NodeJS creating multiple apps. I'm still learning things with databases and other things but I do my best. I'm still a beginner but I would like to collaborate in projects where my skills are pushed to the limits.

To reach me you can hit me up on linkedin:
